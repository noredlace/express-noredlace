# Sample Config Json Provided

JSON Array of the API Model. Values here are the columns from API Calls to return for that column

  i.e. Minecraft API Call returns an object of ip: ###.##.###.##
    Thus the Key of Address has a value of "ip"

Values with N/A were either Secret or just not given by the API

!! This has been deprecated for now !!
